# Sorting Methods Using Bubble and Selection

## Overview
Sorting Methods Using Bubble and Selection is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. This program allows users to input an array of integers, choose a sorting method, and observe the sorting process step-by-step.

## Features
1. **Input Array**: Users can input an array of integers to be sorted.
2. **Bubble Sort**: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, displaying each step of the sorting process.
3. **Selection Sort**: Implements the Selection Sort algorithm, displaying each step of the sorting process.
4. **Menu Interface**: Users can select which sorting method to use or exit the program.
5. **Display Sorted Array**: The program displays the array before and after sorting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and command line operations

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/whdhdyt21/Sorting-Methods-Using-Bubble-and-Selection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sorting-Methods-Using-Bubble-and-Selection
    ```

### Compilation

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o sorting-methods
```

### Running the Program
Run the compiled program:
```bash
./sorting-methods
```

## Usage
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the array, choose the sorting method, and observe the sorting process. The program is designed to be user-friendly with clear prompts for each action.
